	"Using a teleport or exiting a level will swap sisters. Each sister has their own weapons, health and inventory. \c[Cyan]Terri\c- starts with a single \c[Green]Phase Device\c- "

	"\c[Purple]Portia\c- favors shotgun type weapons as a Renegade.\n\n"
	"\c[Green]Phase Devices\c- and \c[Green]Homing Phase Devices\c- will instantly swap between the sisters without teleporting them anywhere. "

	"\c-In an effort to prevent further demonic invasions, the UAC began installing their Quantum Accelerator prototypes at various locations. A small group of marines was "
	"dispatched along with the installation team just in case anything went wrong. Portia and her younger sister, Terri, were among one of these groups when disaster struck; "
	"a malfunction ripped open a portal to hell, and a vile demon stepped through and began ripping the team to shreds. The sisters managed to wound the beast enough for it to "
	"retreat through the portal. But in one final act of malice, it cursed the sisters, trapping their souls between two different dimensions.\n\n"

	"Once close siblings, now split from each other's reality, they will do anything to rid themselves of the curse and see each other again. "
	"Even if it means venturing into hell itself!";
