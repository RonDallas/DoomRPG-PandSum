Knowing bugs:
- Dreamweaver, Plamenix, Chaos Monolith, Dark Cardinal and other can clean themself from Nightmare aura sprite effect (because A_SetRenderStyle(0,STYLE_None);)
- Nightmare aura sprite effect don`t appear on the monsters, if player don`t see them

New:
- Added support 2.4.1 Pandemonia monsterpack
- Reinforcements teleport bug fixed
- Added Pandemonia summons
- Matching difficulty skill names with Pandemonia 
- Added skills description
- Added some sprite replacement from Pandemonia (medkit, stimpack, health/armor bonuses, small bullet mag and medium shells packs) (berserk sprite don`t replaces correctly)
- Added part of fonts from Pandemonia (to fix Pandemonia events don`t shows up on the level start - pand bug itself) (DBIGFONT.fon2 to big for DRPG menus)
- Fixed Abyssal Savage projectiles sprite conflict with DRLA

Knowing bugs:
- The palette bug is on GZDoom 4.11.3 and higher (works ok on VKDoom)
- Need a balance revisions
- Lost souls spawned from pain elementals give player experience (probably other summons do that as well)

Knowing issues (my opinion):
- Monsters deal little bit lot of damage (they do in Pandemonia as well)
- Monsters difficulty overwhelm a player to fast (some high tier monsters spawn to soon)
- Pandemonia monster spawn events and pursuer bosses is separate thing from DRPG
- Pursuer bosses can appear on the arena maps
- Pursuer bosses count maps that player enters again (except Outpost, i think) (they don`t appear there, because Dusted coded that)
- Monsters HP in default hpbar is not that visible with SMALLFNT (don`t know how to fix it - replacing a class is not work) (SMALLFNT need for Pandemonia in events names)
