## Fork Overview

The main goal of this fork is bugfixing/stability & performance improvements; however, some usability/gameplay tweaks have been made.
I recommend reading CHANGELOG.txt and the commits for all the changes.

- DoomRL Arsenal - [1.1.5] [MP-B7.3]
- LegenDoom v2.8.2

Due to how DRPG is programmed, unlisted combos are unsupported and could lead to unstable behaviour.

## Notes

- I, Sumwunn, am personally not comfortable with making gameplay related changes (balance and stuff), so 90% of the time you will just see bugfixes from me.
- Refer to Links.txt for all required tools for compiling.
- I'm just a fan of DoomRPG and want to keep it functioning. I'm not experienced, and very much learning as I go, so feel free to offer any comments. I'm also looking at the TODO list and seeing which I can accomplish. Starting with the small tasks of course!
- Probably forgot something.
